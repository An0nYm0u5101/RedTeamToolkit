# RedTeamToolkit
### *The* Security toolkit for the new Web First Paradigm

Goals :

1. Fully Browser based toolkit making use of the newest web technologies.

2. WASM modules to pull in only what you need.

3. Ability to use within a target organization without having to bring in physical media.

4. Central Reporting and Command UI.

#### No more carrying an entire OS with you to run pentests, pull in anywhere, over HTTPS, DNSSEC or even IPFS
